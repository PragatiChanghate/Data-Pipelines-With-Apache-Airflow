# Data-Pipelines-With-Apache-Airflow

Apache Airflow is a workflow automation platform that is popular for its open-source availability and scheduling capabilities.
You can utilize this tool to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor any number of workflows.
Businesses today use Airflow to organize complex computational workflows, build data processing pipelines, and easily perform ETL processes. 
Airflow operates on DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to construct and represent its workflow, and each DAG is formed of nodes and connectors. 
These Nodes depend on Connectors to link up with the other nodes and generate a dependency tree that manages your work efficiently
